## Analysis ##
The analysis of Citi Bike trip data in New York City has revealed some interesting insights through visualizations. The dashboards include charts and graphs that depict the highest trip starting point, trends in average trip durations over time, age distribution, and gender-based differences in trip durations.

* The most frequent starting point for trips is identified near Central Park S & 6th Avenue, indicating a popular and central location for bike users.
* A noteworthy trend in average trip durations is observed. The duration steadily increased from 1895 to 1940, followed by a decline. However, there are spikes in 1993 and 1994, suggesting unique circumstances or events during that period.
* Average trip duration is highest for people that are 27-29 years old and lowest for people that are 31 years old or between the ages of 97 and 124. Average trip duration increases at a steady rate from the ages of 31 to 82 and then begins to decline. The average age per station ranges from 42 to 54 years old.
* Females have longer average trip durations of 20.55 minutes compared to males at 17.73 minutes. However, the average trip duration for unknown genders is 29.22 minutes. 
* The unknown gender category is a larger proportion that males or females, which suggests that there is room for improvement on reporting.
